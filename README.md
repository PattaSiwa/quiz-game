# quiz-game
Why I made it:
I am currently working as a Youth Support Specailist. I provide direct support to young adults living with disabilities. 
I created this project because I wanted an application that I can use with my students on days we have to work together remotely.


This project is a quiz game that can be easily customized. There are three types of questions that are Classes and extendsions. 
There are two types of multiple choice questions and true or false question. The subjects can be easily added by using the question templates and following the laid out object creation for each subject you want to add.
The project features Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle the questions and answer keys around. 
The shuffle makes the quiz more dynamic and increase replayability by creating different set and order of questions each time a user play.
The game also has a feedback box where user can recieve feedback if they got the answer correct or incorrect.
Incorrect answers will trigger words of encouragements to try again and disable the already chosen answer.
Correct answer will recieve a praise and points. As someone who studied psychology and worked with children, I firmly believe that these little possitive reinforcements can highly improve the user experience and encourage the user to keep playing the game.
